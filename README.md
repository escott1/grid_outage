# grid_outage

simple analysis of a grid outage dataset inspired by an article on Inside Energy: http://insideenergy.org/2014/08/18/data-explore-15-years-of-power-outages/

Contains an ipython notebook used to clean, visualize, and pull out interesting statistics on the dataset. The notebook uses a csv file (grid_outage.csv), which is included in this repo. I've also included a link to the original dataset inside the notebook.
